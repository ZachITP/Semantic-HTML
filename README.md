#### By Zach Hanson 

#### Description
This project implemented Semantic HTML to an already existing website 

## Technologies Used

* Visual Studio code
* Github
* GitLab
* Hyper and GitBash termianl


## Description

While this project did not change the apperance of the website it implemented Semantic HTML which renames all the div containers. Some of the semantic elements added in HTML5 are: Header, nav, main, article, section, aside, footer. This allows the screen reader to understand the code better so it can communicate what is on the screen to someone who might be visually impaired. Photos on the website are also given a decription to help the viewer. Semantic HTML tags help search engine crawlers (SEO) by increasing the likelyhood that your webpage appears on the search engine report (SERP)
